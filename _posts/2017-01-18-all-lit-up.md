About a week and a half ago I finished Elena Ferrante’s [Neapolitan novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_Novels). I started reading Ferrante two years ago during an odd period in my life, and as these things go when the right piece of art finds you at the right time, her work made a permanent home in my poetic memory. 

I say her work, but I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt so much as if I were discovering truth more than reading literature. I’ll be more honest: the impression I was left with, an emotional, over-caffeinated mess in a public coffee shop during a snowstorm, was that the gift of a life more profound than mine could possibly approach was laid out in front of me. It gave me something like a wave of aching reverence.

My thoughts remain more or less fragmented in the aftermath, but I feel impelled to record them anyway, if only to give the event its due. (Or to get it out of my system and spare my roomates from all my stuttering..) 

to make it short: Elena, in her brutality, pettiness, and often myopic attitude toward her friend, gives a more resplendent, devoted tribute than any record of easy, joyful moments, or uncomplicated familiarity. and to be longer about it: Lila is Elena’s great love, or maybe the word love is not enough – I keep looking for a word for something like a constant and lifelong project toward understanding. The tragedy is that in their fascination, or infatuation, with one another, they couldn’t disentangle their own hopes and wishes from the other’s life. It came out in the metaphors and roles in which they fit one another, a shared vocabulary that never fully overlapped. The ownership they feel over the other is often expressed in life as a mother-child relationship, but instead they are chosen sisters, soulmates, in competition yet in some kind of relay race, where there is always a yearning for closeness, and a predilection toward resentment when one teammate moves forward in leaps alien to the other. 

I think to be able to experience such a brimming, fraught love would be the masterpiece of a life. And to name it in all its parts, sketch it out, explain it from beginning to end, is inconceivable. Isn’t that the impulse behind romantic love? To get to a state where you know someone so intimately but never completely – an urge to understand, to predict, and yet to be endlessly surprised. 

In Elena’s romantic love with Nino, she felt a mirror of this fascination, with the result being the eventual, banal uncovering of his flawed character. The terror of that experience is that it is what so often happens in a certain kind of love: a burst of excitement, a feeling that this love is unique, and then once the understanding is complete, the disappointment that this person is only himself and not something larger than life. 

Lila, at least, was unpredictable, maddening, but never banal. Maybe that’s because Elena never understood her, and maybe that’s something unique to Lila; or maybe it’s unique to their relationship with its deepest layers of emotion like the brutal massacre buried under the church in Naples, where pain is quite literally the foundation of the splendor.
