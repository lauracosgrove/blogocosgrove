The state of transit can be profoundly sad to experience. One of dozens in a plane, I feel little and anonymous, barreling through the dramatic cloudly towers and parapets hung static. It’s like someone built a world, forgot about it, and left it there in the air for our jet-setting toddler-consciences to smash up. 

But I think the truer profundity, as close as I can guess it, happens when you arrive. It is self-affirming to get to know yourself in a new environment; it was like the early stages of falling in love, settling in after my displacement, to know for certain in which ways I would change and stay the same, to remember that there’s something going on inside my silly body that is separable from a roiling, inconstant world. 

And it helps me, sometimes, to act the part of a surveyor of some grand interminable project, taking my dips, slips and loopings-back as costs already tallied. You know, if it turns out my life-as-project ends up being a collection of shitty half-built edifices in disarray, one could, at least, conceive of a gullible traveler stumbling across something like that and thinking it interesting, or beautiful, or artful. In short, I am no great pyramid, and here’s no great matter… 

One of the ways in which I doubt I will change is in the shoehorning of bad punnish references in my self-indulgent writing. (I should be punished!)

Anyway…here are some paired photographs of the places I’ve been, begun and ended. Organizing my photos, I noticed pairs who, placed together, make me feel something of a warm uncanniness. They remind me of the strange mix of personal constancy and change that is the project of living, through my eye as a picture-taker - the qualities of the things I have noticed enough to document - and (maybe) through the subjects and places themselves – in my mind as in the universe, let’s say, a much wilier quality.
