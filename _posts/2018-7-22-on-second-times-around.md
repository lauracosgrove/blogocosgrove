	In my senior year of high school, my bike was stolen. That particular evening, I had gone from soccer practice to a journalism work night to my nighttime tutoring job, sinking into my mother’s car at 10 p.m. with little memory left of how the day started. 	The next day I was surprised not to see it in the garage, vaguely disquieted in transit on the city bus, and eventually distraught seeing its absence from where I had locked it -- the neat, seemingly cosmic consequence of my absent-mindedness. Anyone who has lost a well-loved possession out of their own doing knows the same grief: sticky with rumination, surprising in its depth.
  
	Hoping to comfort me, my dad dispensed with a certain wisdom that has had an unusual staying power for me, though I have only recently begun to deliberately follow it. He said that compounding on my busyness was my avoiding letting quiet times happen. In transit I always had headphones in, and once at destinations I was always either engaged with a task or distracted with some other media. For the young, he espoused, leisure time was increasingly devoured with stimulation – given that we had so much to listen, watch, and read, and so many ways to do it. Combine that trend with a shrinking of leisure time itself, and you have an overloaded mind, prone to leaving small things – like how you got to school that morning -- entirely unprocessed and, therefore, discarded.
  
	In the coming years, I would lose many things out of my own doing. In the worst of my depression, in the depth of summer, I wouldn’t be busy anymore because I had stopped going to my job, stopped leaving my bed; but, I remained stimulated, binge-watching Freaks and Geeks or reading fiction on my phone, compulsively and eventually without real enjoyment. This was an unwitting yet intentional contrapositive of my dad’s advice. I stuffed full my expanse of leisure time so as to avoid processing the difficult truths I didn’t have the strength to confront. In this way I discarded my sense of myself, and as a neat, cosmic consequence, I lost much of what was my life.
  
	I am grateful that I didn’t lose my life. Months passed – it came to a head – I took leave from college and returned the next year with sea legs, but no longer drowning. The worst of it was like being trapped in a glass aquarium with my lips pressed against the top, sucking in inches of air and kicking desperately. I could see and talk to people in the world I used to navigate, but in my horribly confusing and painful situation, I alternately felt gawked at and inaccessibly alien. Coming back, it was like I had finally found the exit hatch, but I emerged dripping and smelling faintly of mold.
  
	The sun is a disinfectant, gentle and slow. Out of my alien world, I gradually found myself reacquainted with a full spectrum of feeling: joy, full-throated, and sorrow, and the kind of desire that is directional but not annihilating. I graduated, moved to New York. I made friends, and I did well at my job, even excelled. My conception of what I could do with myself evolved from simply walking among the people to things new, specific, and exciting. I fell in a beautiful, satiating love that is in so many ways unimaginable but for its reality. I got to know my ambition again, moving like a river in springtime, sharp and strong.
  
	Last summer was my first truly wonderful summer since I had left for college. This autumn I return to school for a master’s program. The anticipation of this event has gotten me thinking about second chances, and whether you can predict the patterns that will come back around. One thing I think I know is that thinking about my history, processing it, may be a salve that’s hard to crack.
  
	 In 2017, before springtime, I bought a bicycle. I love it even more than the one I once lost, and I try to remember to leave off the headphones when I bike home from work now and again. A daily practice of quietude is well-suited for the forty-odd minutes of physical movement, and especially now, I can name shapes in the rear-view mirror I couldn’t discern when rushing past them. Excavatory or circular, I’m not sure – but as I come back to something similar, I welcome a second time around, traveled with the companion of my personal history.
   
	Nietzsche wrestled with the idea of a reality in which human actions have their place in the infinite by means of repetition. He wrote that a person’s wish for eternal recurrence would be the ultimate attainment of meaning and affirmation of life. At the same time, the idea of repeating one’s actions perpetually, when actions are made without knowledge of eternity but under the blinder of free will, is a burden of das schwerste Gewicht, the “heaviest weight”.
  
	You can’t go home again, but you can experience the facsimile of return -- a facsimile, because the return doesn’t carry the power of the infinite, but only a space on the much-too-real line of a life. The great burden of a past that would seem to circle back around and smack you in the face is made lighter when, in a perspective of play, you jump on top and nudge it in a new direction, remade, tamed.
