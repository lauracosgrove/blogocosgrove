title: beauty is not quite a title

It’s also not quite a photograph. I forget this fact, and when I’m with my camera and find beauty, I feel a kind of itching, soul-aching duty to take it all down for posterity; as if there were not already a glut of forgettably pretty pictures to look at in this world, and as if I’m not in low-light environment with a not very iso-sensitive rig or behind a slightly dirty windshield with a slightly dirtier lens. (A good thing about me is that I take disappointments in stride..)

An arrangement in the world that triggers the warm wash of aesthetic appreciation can make us feel like that thing was made for our eyes to see. Beauty communicated secondhand is one project of art, I think, because of our impulse to hold and share that instant of connectedness, where by some weird luck, observation alone provides a surprising gift.

exhortation, unsolicited: Drive along highway 4 from the east Calaveras hills back to the bay area, after a winter rain, to find the kind of beauty you want to catch. You will find it a million more times in countless other places, but I don’t know if there’s pictures or words (certainly neither of mine) that could share that particular flavor with you. Maybe in the ingredients of motion alone - breezing past the still landscapes, the constant losing and finding again – the phenomenon of beauty comes to us more easily, because at the tail end of beautiful is usually sorrow. 

Here are some little failures to communicate, hope you enjoy. (but not too much because that obviates the entire point of this post)
